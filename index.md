## About Me

I am a resident physician in Ophthalmology at Brown University. 

Latest CV: [last updated 2024/09](assets/files/2024-09_Lieng_CV.pdf)

I am fascinated by the intersection of information technology and medicine. 

My PhD dissertation focused on evaluating transitions in care from generalists to specialists, particularly studying changes in provider communication associated with telemedicine. My research interests also include evaluating the impact of telemedicine on medically underserved patient populations as well as clinical data analysis and visualization. I graduated from Juniata College with a B.S. in Biology and minors in Studio Art and Spanish. During my pre-clinical years in medical school, I served as a Co-Director of Flu Crew and as a Co-Director of Knights Landing One Health Clinic.
